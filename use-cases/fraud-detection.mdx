## 1. Unified Transformation Definition for Training and Inference

In fraud detection, models need to operate in real-time as new transactions occur. Traditionally, ML teams create separate pipelines for offline model training and real-time inference, leading to maintenance complexities. With Featureform, you define your data transformations once and use them seamlessly for both training and real-time serving. This unified approach simplifies development and ensures consistency.

## 2. Empowering Data Scientists with an Improved Feature Engineering Workflow

The quality of features is paramount in improving fraud detection models. Featureform empowers data scientists to easily iterate on feature engineering and collaborate efficiently. This flexibility allows teams to create high-quality features and build superior models faster.

## 3. Proactive Monitor and Address Concept Drift

Fraud detection models are sensitive to changes in data distribution and fraud methodologies. Featureform includes built-in monitoring capabilities, enabling ML teams to proactively update models when data drifts or fraud patterns change. This proactive approach helps maintain model performance and adapt to evolving threats.
