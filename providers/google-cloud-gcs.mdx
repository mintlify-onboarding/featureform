## Configuration

First we have to add a declarative GCS configuration in Python.

```python gcs_config.py
import featureform as ff

gcs = ff.register_gcs(
    name="gcs-quickstart",
    credentials=ff.GCPCredentials(...),
    bucket_name="bucket_name",
    bucket_path="featureform/path/",
    description="An gcs store provider to store offline"
)

client.apply()
```

We can re-verify that the provider is created by checking the [Providers tab of the Feature Registry or via the CLI](../getting-started/search-monitor-discovery-feature-registry-ui-cli.md).
