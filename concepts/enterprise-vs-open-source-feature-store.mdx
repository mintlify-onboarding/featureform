title: "Open-Source vs. Enterprise Featureform: What Sets Them Apart"
description: "At Featureform, we are deeply committed to delivering an exceptional standalone experience with our open-source product. However, as a business, we adhere to an open-core philosophy. Since the inception of our open-source offering, we've been transparent about the two primary distinctions between the open-source version and Featureform Enterprise: **streaming data support** and **governance, ACLs, and audit logs**. All other features we charge for fall under the purview of SLAs, cloud hosting, and dedicated support."

Furthermore, it's worth noting that we often introduce alpha and beta features to customers of Featureform Enterprise who collaborate with us as design partners. This collaborative effort helps us refine the API before we eventually open-source the feature. Our ultimate goal is to make everything available as open source, with the exception of streaming and governance functionalities.
